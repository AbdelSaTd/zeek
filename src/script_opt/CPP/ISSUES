conditional code:
	- top-level conditionals okay due to hash protection
	- but lower-level, directly called, won't translate

	possible approaches:
		- warn when compiling such functions
		- an option to always do Invoke's rather than direct calls
		- rewrite scripts to use run-time conditionals
			(in base scripts, it's almost all regarding clusters)

type switches:
	- easy to support by some sort of hash on the type

when's:
	- need to understand "return when" semantics

slow compilation:
	- try splitting initialization routine into a bunch of subroutines
	- analyze whether there's a bunch of unneeded stuff (e.g. orphan types)

efficiency:
	- leverage ZVal's directly
	- directly calling BiFs
		- best done by supplanting bifcl
	- event handlers directly called, using vector<ZVal> arguments
	- import custom BiFs (e.g. network_time()) from ZAM
